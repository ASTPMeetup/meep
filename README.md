## Project Overview 

The Metropolitan Energy Center (MEC) is a nonprofit promoting energy efficiency, economic development, and environmental vitality in and around Kansas City. As the coordinator of Kansas City's local Clean Cities Coalition, the organization works to raise awareness of the contributions of fleet operators, alternative fuel providers, vehicle manufacturers and distributors, and others interested in improving air quality and reducing the use of foreign oil. The MEC also takes an active role in reducing energy consumption of residential and commercial buildings by providing training, online tools, and low cost audits. 

The aim of this project is to create a central database that consolidates the MEC's data on the impact their programs have on reducing emmisions and improving public health, and then to create a map-based interface to the data. This app will provide the MEC with a means to summarize the efficacy of their work to their funders, and will be used to increase the general public's awareness of local projects dedicated to improving sustainabilty.
